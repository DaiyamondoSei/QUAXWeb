Quantum theory is not just a revolution in physics—it's a revolution in how we understand consciousness itself. The boundaries between observer and observed, mind and matter, are dissolving in the quantum age.

> "Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental." — Erwin Schrödinger

In this article, we explore how quantum principles are inspiring new models of the mind, and how the QUANNEX community is pioneering the integration of science and consciousness for the next leap in human evolution.
